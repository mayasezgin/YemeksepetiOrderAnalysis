# YemeksepetiOrderAnalysis

## Dataset Description 
The dataset in this project is derived from two main sources:

1. **Yemeksepeti Order History:** My personal data from past food orders, including:
   
   -**Order Date and Time:** The exact time when an order was placed.
   
   -**Order Type:** The cuisine type (e.g. kebab, pizza).
   
   -**Order Amount:** The total cost of each order.
   
   -**Day Classification:** Weekday or weekend.
   
2. **Academic Calendar:** Personal academic workload data, including:
   -**Class Schedule:** Weekly academic commitments.
   -**Exam Period:** Dates and times of exams or intensive study periods.

By combining these two data sources, the dataset allows us to analyze the impact of academic workload on food ordering behavior, particularly focusing on weekend order patterns.

## Project Idea 
This project which is for my DSA210 (Introduction to Data Science) course aims to analyze the increase in weekend orders on Yemeksepeti and investigate its connection to academic workload during weekdays. The hypothesis is that:

-Weekend orders are influenced by the need to relax after a busy week of academic stress.

The project will provide insights into how external factors influence food ordering behavior.

## Plan 
1. **Data Preparation:**
   
- Clean and structure the dataset.
- Add new features, such as weekday/weekend classification.
  
2. **Data Analysis:**
   
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns. - Compare order counts and spending between weekdays and weekends. 3. **Hypothesis Testing:** 
- Test if weekend orders are statistically higher than weekday orders. - Analyze correlations between academic workload and ordering behavior. 4.**Visualization:** 
- Use graphs and charts to illustrate: 
- Order trends by day. 
- Spending patterns. 
- Popular cuisines. 
5.**Reporting:** 
- Summarize findings and provide actionable insights. - Include visualizations to support conclusions.
